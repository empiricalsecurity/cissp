# CISSP Mindset

* Your role is a risk advisor
* Do not fix problems
* Who is responsible for security?
* How much security is enough?
* All decisions start with risk management.
* Risk management starts with identifying and valuating your assets
* "Security Transcends Technology"
* Physical safety is always the highest priority.
* Technical questions are for managers.  Management questions are for technicians.
* Incorporate security into the design as opposed to addit on later.
* Layered Defense!  (IE Defense in Depth)
