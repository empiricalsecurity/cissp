# CISSP Mindset

* Your role is a risk advisor, not a manager, you advise, not decide.
* Do not fix problems.  You are not a technician for this exam.
* Think processes and change management, not only solutions!  IF there is a process that is riddled with red tape, it's probably the answer.
* Who is responsible for security?  Ultimately it is Senior Management, but all employees are responsible for following the policies that senior management has put in place.
* How much security is enough?  Just enough.  Every security decision should be driven by a cost benefit analysis.
* All decisions start with risk management.  Value assessment, chance of loss, impact of loss.
* Risk management starts with identifying and valuating your assets
* "Security Transcends Technology"
* Physical safety is always the highest priority.
* Technical questions are for managers.  Management questions are for technicians.  IE, don't go too deep.
* Incorporate security into the design as opposed to adding it on later.
* Layered Defense!  (IE Defense in Depth)
